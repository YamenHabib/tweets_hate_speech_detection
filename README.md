In this notebook [tweets_hate_speech_detection](https://github.com/YamenHabib/tweets_hate_speech_detection/blob/main/tweets_hate_speech_detection.ipynb) we are getting to know our dataset, building the model and test it before and after traingin.

in this notebook [ploting_precision_recall_curve](https://github.com/YamenHabib/tweets_hate_speech_detection/blob/main/ploting_precision_recall_curve.ipynb) we are using Tensorbord to plot PR-curve.
